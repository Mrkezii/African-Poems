Of Africa, Kikuyu, quick as flies,
Batten upon the bloodstreams of the veldt.
Corpses are scattered through a paradise.
Only the worm, colonel of carrion, cries:
'Waste no compassion on these separate dead!'
Statistics justify and scholars seize
The salients of colonial policy.
What is that to the white child hacked in bed?
To savages, expendable as Jews?
Threshed out by beaters, the long rushes break
In a white dust of ibises whose cries
Have wheeled since civilizations dawn
>From the parched river or beast-teeming plain.
The violence of beast on beast is read
As natural law, but upright man
Seeks his divinity by inflicting pain.
Delirious as these worried beasts, his wars
Dance to the tightened carcass of a drum, 
While he calls courage still that native dread
Of the white peace contracted by the dead.

Again brutish necessity wipes its hands
Upon the napkin of a dirty cause, again
A waste of our compassion, as with Spain,
The gorilla wrestles with the superman.
I who am poisoned with the blood of both,
Where shall I turn, divided to the vein?
I who have cursed
The drunken officer of British rule, how choose
Between this Africa and the English tongue I love?
Betray them both, or give back what they give?
How can I face such slaughter and be cool?
How can I turn from Africa and live?

            <div id="2"><p> "A Memorial Of Africa - Poem by George MacDonald<br>
            Upon a rock I sat-a mountain-side,
Far, far forsaken of the old sea's lip;
A rock where ancient waters' rise and dip,
Recoil and plunge, eddy, and oscillant tide,
Had worn and worn, while races lived and died,
Involved channels. Where the sea-weed's drip
Followed the ebb, now crumbling lichens sip
Sparse dews of heaven that down with sunset slide.
I sat long-gazing southward. A dry flow
Of withering wind sucked up my drooping strength,
Itself weak from the desert's burning length.
Behind me piled, away and up did go
Great sweeps of savage mountains-up, away,
Where snow gleams ever, panthers roam, they say.<p></p>

        <div id="3">"A Toast To Africa , Carrie Williams Clifford<br>Christmas, 1920

From a goblet of rarest and richest red gold,
Encrusted with jewels of value untold,
All flowing and glowing with nectar of wine,
Distilled from the spirits of souls sweet and fine
As these sons and daughters whose deeds I rehearse,
With zeal all-consuming, though halting my verse--
I drink to my Race on this epochal morn,
Remembering the Christ-child who came lowly-born,--
Was despised, crucified and rejected of men,
But now to whom honor and glory--Amen!  <p></p>       </div>
            
        <div id="4">"Nikki-Rosa - Poem by Nikki Giovanni<br>Childhood rememberances are 
always a drag if you're Black 
you always remember things like 
living in Woodlawn with no inside toilet 
and if you become famous or something
They never talk about how happy 
you were to have your mother 
all to yourself and how good the 
water felt when you got your bath 
from one of those
Big tubs that folk in chicago barbeque 
in and somehow when you talk 
about home 
it never gets across how much you 
understood their feelings as the 
whole family attended meetings

About Hollydale and even though you 
remember your biographers never 
understand your father's pain as he 
sells his stock and another 
dream goes
And though your're poor it isn't 
poverty that concerns you and 
though they fought a lot 
it isn't your father's drinking that 
makes any difference but only that

Everybody is together and you 
and your sister have happy birthdays 
and very good Christmasses and I 
really hope no white person ever has 
cause to write about me 
because they never understand
Black love is Black wealth and they'll 
probably talk about my hard childhood 
and never understand that 
all the while I was quite happy.<p></p>         </div>

            <div id="6">" Homage To My Hips - Poem by Lucille Clif<br>These hips are big hips.
they need space to 
move around in.
they don't fit into little
petty places. these hips
are free hips.
they don't like to be held back.
these hips have never been enslaved,
they go where they want to go 
they do what they want to do. 
these hips are mighty hips.
these hips are magic hips.
i have known them
to put a spell on a man and 
spin him like a top <p></p>

        <div id="7">"An African Elegy - Poem by Robert Duncan<br>In the groves of Africa from their natural wonder 
the wildebeest, zebra, the okapi, the elephant, 
have enterd the marvelous. No greater marvelous 
know I than the mind’s 
natural jungle. The wives of the Congo 
distil there their red and the husbands 
hunt lion with spear and paint Death-spore 
on their shields, wear his teeth, claws and hair 
on ordinary occasions. There the Swahili 
open his doors, let loose thru the trees 
the tides of Death’s sound and distil 
from their leaves the terrible red. He 
is the consort of dreams I have seen, heard 
in the orchestral dark 
like the barking of dogs. 


Death is the dog-headed man zebra striped 
and surrounded by silence who walks like a lion, 
who is black. It was his voice crying come back, 
that Virginia Woolf heard, turnd 
her fine skull, hounded and haunted, stopt, 
pointed into the scent where 
I see her in willows, in fog, at the river of sound 
in the trees. I see her prepare there 
to enter Death’s mountains 
like a white Afghan hound pass into the forest, 
closed after, let loose in the leaves 
with more grace than a hound and more wonder there 
even with flowers wound in her hair, allowing herself 
like Ophelia a last 
pastoral gesture of love toward the world. 
And I see 
all our tortures absolved in the fog, 
dispersed in Death’s forests, forgotten. I see 
all this gentleness like a hound in the water 
float upward and outward beyond my dark hand. 


I am waiting this winter for the more complete black-out, 
for the negro armies in the eucalyptus, for the cities 
laid open and the cold in the love-light, for hounds 
women and birds to go back to their forests and leave us 
our solitude.

. . .

Negroes, negroes, all those princes, 
holding cups of rhinoceros bone, make 
magic with my blood. Where beautiful Marijuana 
towers taller than the eucalyptus, turns 
within the lips of night and falls, 
falls downward, where as giant Kings we gathered 
and devourd her burning hands and feet, O Moonbar 
thee and Clarinet! those talismans 
that quickened in their sheltering leaves like thieves, 
those Negroes, all those princes 
holding to their mouths like Death 
the cups of rhino bone, 
were there to burn my hands and feet, 
divine the limit of the bone and with their magic 
tie and twist me like a rope. I know 
no other continent of Africa more dark than this 
dark continent of my breast. 


And when we are deserted there, 
when the rustling electric has passt thru the air, 
once more we begin in the blind and blood throat 
the African catches; and Desdemona, Desdemona 
like a demon wails within our bodies, warns 
against this towering Moor of self and then 
laments her passing from him. 


And I cry, Hear! 
Hear in the coild and secretive ear 
the drums that I hear beat. The Negroes, all those princes 
holding cups of bone and horn, are there in halls 
of blood that I call forests, in the dark 
and shining caverns where 
beats heart and pulses brain, in 
jungles of my body, there 
Othello moves, striped black and white, 
the dog-faced fear. Moves I, I, I, 
whom I have seen as black as Orpheus, 
pursued deliriously his sound and drownd 
in hunger’s tone, the deepest wilderness. 


Then it was I, Death singing, 
who bewildered the forest. I thot him 
my lover like a hound of great purity 
disturbing the shadow and flesh of the jungle. 
This was the beginning of the ending year. 
From all of the empty the tortured appear, 
and the bird-faced children crawl out of their fathers 
and into that never filld pocket, 
the no longer asking but silent, seeing nowhere 
the final sleep. 


The halls of Africa we seek in dreams 
as barriers of dream against the deep, and seas 
disturbd turn back upon their tides 
into the rooms deserted at the roots of love. 
There is no end. And how sad then 
is even the Congo. How the tired sirens 
come up from the water, not to be toucht 
but to lie on the rocks of the thunder. 
How sad then is even the marvelous! <p></p></div>
            <div id="8">"A Trip Through Africa - Poem by Abraham Sutzkever<br>

All the noises, all the sounds, asleep.
Under seven streams sleeps fear.
And the elephant, so deep in sleep,
That you can sneak up, cut off his ear.
All the noises, all the sounds, asleep.
No rough axe will wake them, make them hear.
All the noises, all the sounds, asleep
In two eyes, two eyes still open deep—
The two eyes of God, still open deep. 
<p></p></div>
            <div id="9">"Now It's Your Turn Africa - Poem by Akhtar Jawad<br>

Everyone has touched the apex of time, 
I see with joy climax of time, 
The clock struck all parts of the planet, 
Now I listen to the drums and clarinet, 
The clock slowly moves but it moves, 
Nature is just and honest in grooves, 
You remained a victim of worst imperialism, 
Exploitation and injustice of ugly colonialism, 
Slowly but surely the needle is moving, 
The divine weaver is busy in weaving, 
A lovely and colorful dress for you, 
A happy prosperous redress for you, 
You will forget your entire past grievance, 
I salute to your nice and great tolerance, 
Make preparations for your rimes Africa, 
Ahead of you lovely times Africa! 
Wish you good luck for the morning bell, 
Now it's your turn Africa that I smell.<p></p></div>

Africa my mother land
land of milk and honey
land of natural beauty
Africa land where i live

Africa my Africa
A land of great rulers
Africa my Africa

A land were nature lives

A land blessed by God himself
On the day of creation 
God threw diamond like stone
gold like rain
He dropped crude oil like rain

Africa my Africa
